# Homely - ASP.NET Core MVC Helpers

This library contains a collection of helpers, models and extension methods that help reduce the time and ceremony to improve an ASP.NET MVC WebApi/RESTful API.

---

## Sample / highlights

- Automatic Model Validation (will be removed/replaced with MVC2.1 when that is released Q3/Q4 2018).
- Consistent Api Error schema.
- All Error Responses are in JSON format (this is an API after all...)
- Can optionally set CORS headers for JSON API Errors.
